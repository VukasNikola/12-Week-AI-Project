Today I was learning about git and how to use it. I will keep learning as I go along with the project. I understand the push/pull, issues came up with naming of branches. Origin is an allias for the remote repo. I feel like I understand it when I don't get too deep into complications, but hopefully with time I will be able to learn everything properly. I will be using ChatGPT for help with git, I will avoid using it for coding.
