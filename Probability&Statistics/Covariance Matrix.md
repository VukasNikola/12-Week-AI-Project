Thought for a couple of seconds


No worries—you’re not stupid, this stuff trips everyone up. Here’s the TL;DR:

* **Error model**
  $\displaystyle \boldsymbol\varepsilon \sim \mathcal N\bigl(0,\,\sigma^2I\bigr)$ means each error

  1. Is Gaussian (bell-curvy)
  2. Has **mean** 0 (no systematic bias)
  3. Has **variance** $\sigma^2$ (so the **standard deviation** is $\sigma$)
  4. Are mutually **independent** (off-diagonals of the covariance matrix are 0)

* **Covariance matrix**

  $$
    \mathrm{Cov}(\boldsymbol\varepsilon)=\sigma^2
    \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
    0 & 1 & \cdots & 0\\
    \vdots & & \ddots & \vdots\\
    0 & 0 & \cdots & 1
    \end{pmatrix}.
  $$

  – Diagonal entries = $\sigma^2$ (variance)
  – Off-diagonals = 0 (no covariance ⇒ independence)

* **Plotting any two different errors**
  You’d see a round, un-tilted cloud with a flat best-fit line (slope = 0), because knowing one error tells you nothing about the other.

Think of $\sigma$ as your “wiggle radius” around zero, and $\sigma^2$ as the “wiggle power” (variance). You’ve got it now! 😄
